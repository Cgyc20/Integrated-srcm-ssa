title: "Toggle invasion: A at edges vs B in center"
description: >
  Two-species competitive toggle with second-order mutual inhibition and logistic self-regulation.
  IC: A seeded at both edges; B seeded in the middle. Produces clean invasion fronts.

notes:
  - "A starts at both edges, B in the middle: watch two clean fronts form."
  - "Increase gamma for sharper interfaces; increase diffusion for smoother mixing."
